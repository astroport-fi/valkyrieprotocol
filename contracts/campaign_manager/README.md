# Valkyrie Campaign Manager
The campaign manager contract manages the shared settings of the campaign and the fees incurred in depositing and withdrawing campaign rewards.
Some of the fees are burned at a set rate, and some are paid as rewards to the governance stakers. The burn rate and non-burn volume collection wallet can be changed through governance voting.
All native tokens, cw20 tokens deposited into the campaign manager contract are considered fees. Tokens that can be exchanged for VKR are frequently exchanged for VKR and burned/transferred.
